## Professional Self-Assessment:
I am a Computer Science graduate who completed a comprehensive and technically rigorous program through Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my coursework and the creation of my ePortfolio, I developed strong foundations in software engineering, problem solving, data management, and system-level thinking. Developing this portfolio allowed me to reflect on my technical growth, clarify my career goals, and demonstrate my readiness to contribute in professional software engineering environments.

My academic experience covered a broad range of computer science disciplines, including programming languages, data structures, computer systems, and full-stack development. Courses such as Programming Languages, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Full Stack Development strengthened my ability to create efficient, readable code and design scalable, maintainable software. Through hands-on projects, I implemented fundamental structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees, while applying algorithmic techniques to optimize performance and memory usage.

I also gained experience with system architecture and low-level software behavior through coursework in computer systems and reverse engineering. These experiences expanded my understanding of how software interacts with hardware, memory management, and operating systems. In addition, I developed practical skills in database design by writing optimized SQL queries and building normalized schemas to support reliable, scalable applications.

Communication was a central part of my academic development. I practiced writing clear technical documentation, creating structured project explanations, and translating complex technical work into reports that could be understood by both technical and non-technical audiences. These experiences strengthened my ability to justify technical decisions and clearly communicate software design concepts.

Throughout the program, I developed experience working within collaborative academic environments through peer feedback, design discussions, and shared problem-solving activities. I strengthened my ability to explain technical concepts clearly, incorporate constructive feedback, and adapt my work to meet stakeholder and project requirements. These experiences prepared me to contribute effectively in professional development settings.

Security awareness was developed through coursework in cybersecurity and secure software analysis. I learned the importance of defensive programming, proper input validation, and protecting applications from common vulnerabilities. This experience shaped my mindset to prioritize security and data protection throughout the development lifecycle.

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio represent the progression of my technical skills across multiple computer science domains. Together, they demonstrate how my abilities in programming, data structures, databases, system architecture, and secure development combine to create reliable and maintainable software. Each artifact highlights a different dimension of my growth and, collectively, they present a comprehensive view of my capabilities as a computer science professional.

## Project Enhancements:
### Artifact 1 - Software Engineering & Design
I enhanced my original CS 300 Course Planner program by restructuring it around a single, well-designed CourseManager class to improve organization, readability, and long-term maintainability. This refactor demonstrated my ability to improve functional code using sound software engineering principles and thoughtful design planning. The process strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of how structure impacts software quality.

This enhancement showcases my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions, apply professional engineering practices, and clearly document technical decisions. It reflects my focus on producing clean, maintainable architectures suitable for collaborative and professional environments.

### Artifact 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures
For this enhancement, I improved the performance and structure of my CS 300 Course Planner program by optimizing search behavior and standardizing data processing. While the original implementation met functional requirements, it relied on repeated lookups and produced inconsistent output. I addressed these issues by refining prerequisite checks, improving data organization, and implementing consistent sorting logic.

This work demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic thinking, select appropriate data structures, and evaluate trade-offs between efficiency and complexity. It highlights my focus on building solutions that are both reliable and scalable.

### Artifact 3 - Databases
I enhanced my CS 340 AnimalShelter program by improving its security and reliability while preserving its MongoDB-based CRUD functionality. The primary updates included removing hardcoded database credentials, introducing environment-based configuration, and adding stronger input validation and structured error handling. These changes improved both data protection and application stability.

This enhancement reflects my ability to integrate secure development practices into database-driven applications and to manage sensitive information responsibly. It demonstrates a security-focused mindset and a commitment to building resilient, trustworthy systems.

## Code Review

Although a video presentation was recommended for the informal code review, I completed a structured written code review for each selected artifact. This process involved examining the original implementations in detail, identifying opportunities for improvement in structure, logic, performance, and security, and documenting planned enhancements prior to implementation. This written review served the same purpose as a video walkthrough by supporting clear technical reasoning, professional communication, and thoughtful planning before development changes were made.
