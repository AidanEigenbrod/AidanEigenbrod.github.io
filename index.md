## Professional Self-Assessment:
I am a Computer Science graduate who completed a comprehensive and technically rigorous program through Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my coursework and the development of my ePortfolio, I developed strong foundations in software engineering, problem solving, data management, and system-level thinking. Building this portfolio allowed me to reflect on my growth as a developer, clarify my professional goals, and demonstrate my readiness to contribute in professional software engineering environments.

My academic experience spans multiple areas of computer science, including programming languages, data structures, computer systems, and full-stack development. Courses such as Programming Languages, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Full Stack Development strengthened my ability to write clean, efficient code and design maintainable software solutions. Through hands-on assignments, I implemented core structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees, and applied algorithmic concepts to improve performance and memory usage.

In addition, I developed experience with system architecture, operating concepts, and low-level software behavior through coursework in computer systems and reverse engineering. These experiences expanded my understanding of how software interacts with hardware, memory, and operating systems. I also built strong skills in database design and management, writing optimized SQL queries and designing normalized schemas to support scalable and reliable applications.

Communication played a significant role in my academic development. I gained experience writing technical documentation, designing clear project explanations, and translating technical work into structured reports suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences. This strengthened my ability to clearly present ideas, justify technical decisions, and document complex systems in a professional manner.

Security awareness was developed through coursework in cybersecurity and software analysis, where I learned the importance of secure coding practices, input validation, and protecting software against common vulnerabilities. I developed a strong appreciation for defensive programming and the role of security at every stage of development.

The artifacts in this ePortfolio reflect the progression of my skills across key technical areas. Together, they demonstrate how my abilities in programming, data structures, databases, system architecture, and secure development work together to create reliable software. Each artifact highlights a different aspect of my technical growth, and collectively they present a clear picture of my capabilities as a computer science professional.

## Project Enhancements:
### Artifact 1 - Software Engineering & Design
I enhanced my original CS 300 Course Planner program by reorganizing it into a single, well-structured CourseManager class to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability. This update showed my ability to refactor working software using sound design principles, focus on long-term structure, and carefully plan changes to preserve functionality. The process strengthened my problem-solving skills and confidence in improving existing code.

### Artifact 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures
I selected my CS 300 Course Planner program to enhance its performance and structure by improving search efficiency and organizing how data is processed. The original program functioned correctly, but it performed unnecessary repeated lookups and produced inconsistent output, which I addressed by optimizing prerequisite checks and implementing more efficient data handling. This project demonstrates my ability to apply stronger algorithmic and data structure decisions to improve existing software. The enhancement process strengthened my problem-solving skills and confidence in analyzing and refining code for better performance and reliability.

### Artifact 3 - Databases
I enhanced my CS 340 AnimalShelter program by improving its security and reliability while maintaining its core MongoDB CRUD functionality. The updates focused on removing hardcoded database credentials, using environment variables to protect sensitive information, and adding stronger input validation and error handling. This project demonstrates my ability to apply secure coding practices and improve existing database-driven applications. The process increased my awareness of how important it is to design software with security in mind from the start.

## Code Review
My informal code review video walks through the existing functionality of the program, explaining how the main features work before any enhancements are made. I analyze the structure, logic, efficiency, and security of the code to identify areas that need improvement and clearly explain why those changes are necessary. The video also outlines my planned enhancements and how they align with the course outcomes, while demonstrating my ability to communicate technical ideas in a clear, professional way. This process is useful because it documents my thought process, helps others quickly understand the project, and allows peers or managers to provide feedback before changes are finalized.
