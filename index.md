## Professioanl Self assesment
I am a Computer Science graduate who completed a comprehensive and technically rigorous program through Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my coursework and the development of my ePortfolio, I developed strong foundations in software engineering, problem solving, data management, and system-level thinking. Building this portfolio allowed me to reflect on my growth as a developer, clarify my professional goals, and demonstrate my readiness to contribute in professional software engineering environments.

My academic experience spans multiple areas of computer science, including programming languages, data structures, computer systems, and full-stack development. Courses such as Programming Languages, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Full Stack Development strengthened my ability to write clean, efficient code and design maintainable software solutions. Through hands-on assignments, I implemented core structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees, and applied algorithmic concepts to improve performance and memory usage.

In addition, I developed experience with system architecture, operating concepts, and low-level software behavior through coursework in computer systems and reverse engineering. These experiences expanded my understanding of how software interacts with hardware, memory, and operating systems. I also built strong skills in database design and management, writing optimized SQL queries and designing normalized schemas to support scalable and reliable applications.

Communication played a significant role in my academic development. I gained experience writing technical documentation, designing clear project explanations, and translating technical work into structured reports suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences. This strengthened my ability to clearly present ideas, justify technical decisions, and document complex systems in a professional manner.

Security awareness was developed through coursework in cybersecurity and software analysis, where I learned the importance of secure coding practices, input validation, and protecting software against common vulnerabilities. I developed a strong appreciation for defensive programming and the role of security at every stage of development.

The artifacts in this ePortfolio reflect the progression of my skills across key technical areas. Together, they demonstrate how my abilities in programming, data structures, databases, system architecture, and secure development work together to create reliable software. Each artifact highlights a different aspect of my technical growth, and collectively they present a clear picture of my capabilities as a computer science professional.
