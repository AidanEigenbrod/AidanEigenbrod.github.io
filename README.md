## Professional Self-Assessment:
I am a Computer Science graduate who completed a comprehensive and technically rigorous program through Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Throughout my coursework and the development of my ePortfolio, I developed strong foundations in software engineering, problem solving, data management, and system-level thinking. Building this portfolio allowed me to reflect on my growth as a developer, clarify my professional goals, and demonstrate my readiness to contribute in professional software engineering environments.

My academic experience spans multiple areas of computer science, including programming languages, data structures, computer systems, and full-stack development. Courses such as Programming Languages, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Full Stack Development strengthened my ability to write clean, efficient code and design maintainable software solutions. Through hands-on assignments, I implemented core structures such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees, and applied algorithmic concepts to improve performance and memory usage.

In addition, I developed experience with system architecture, operating concepts, and low-level software behavior through coursework in computer systems and reverse engineering. These experiences expanded my understanding of how software interacts with hardware, memory, and operating systems. I also built strong skills in database design and management, writing optimized SQL queries and designing normalized schemas to support scalable and reliable applications.

Communication played a significant role in my academic development. I gained experience writing technical documentation, designing clear project explanations, and translating technical work into structured reports suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences. This strengthened my ability to clearly present ideas, justify technical decisions, and document complex systems in a professional manner.

Throughout my coursework, I gained experience working in collaborative environments by participating in peer code reviews, discussion-based design planning, and shared problem-solving activities. I practiced communicating technical ideas clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences, incorporating feedback to improve my designs and implementations. These experiences strengthened my ability to support team decision-making, adapt to stakeholder needs, and contribute effectively in professional software development environments.

Security awareness was developed through coursework in cybersecurity and software analysis, where I learned the importance of secure coding practices, input validation, and protecting software against common vulnerabilities. I developed a strong appreciation for defensive programming and the role of security at every stage of development.

The artifacts in this ePortfolio reflect the progression of my skills across key technical areas. Together, they demonstrate how my abilities in programming, data structures, databases, system architecture, and secure development work together to create reliable software. Each artifact highlights a different aspect of my technical growth, and collectively they present a clear picture of my capabilities as a computer science professional.

## Project Enhancements:
### Artifact 1 - Software Engineering & Design
I enhanced my original CS 300 Course Planner program by reorganizing it into a single, well-structured CourseManager class to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability. This update showed my ability to refactor working software using sound design principles, focus on long-term structure, and carefully plan changes to preserve functionality. The process strengthened my problem-solving skills and confidence in improving existing code.

This enhancement demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions, apply sound software engineering principles, and communicate technical decisions clearly. It supports collaboration and professional documentation through structured design improvements and maintainable architecture.

### Artifact 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures
I selected my CS 300 Course Planner program to enhance its performance and structure by improving search efficiency and organizing how data is processed. The original program functioned correctly, but it performed unnecessary repeated lookups and produced inconsistent output, which I addressed by optimizing prerequisite checks and implementing more efficient data handling. This project demonstrates my ability to apply stronger algorithmic and data structure decisions to improve existing software. The enhancement process strengthened my problem-solving skills and confidence in analyzing and refining code for better performance and reliability.

This enhancement demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic principles, improve performance through efficient data structures, and manage trade-offs in design decisions. It reflects my ability to evaluate and refine solutions for reliability and scalability.

### Artifact 3 - Databases
I enhanced my CS 340 AnimalShelter program by improving its security and reliability while maintaining its core MongoDB CRUD functionality. The updates focused on removing hardcoded database credentials, using environment variables to protect sensitive information, and adding stronger input validation and error handling. This project demonstrates my ability to apply secure coding practices and improve existing database-driven applications. The process increased my awareness of how important it is to design software with security in mind from the start.

This enhancement demonstrates my ability to apply secure coding practices, handle sensitive data responsibly, and design reliable database-driven applications. It reflects a strong security mindset and attention to protecting system resources and user data.

## Code Review
My informal code review video provides a walkthrough of the original functionality of my selected artifacts before any enhancements were made. In the video, I explain how each program worked, identify areas for improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, and security, and justify the planned enhancements. I also explain how the enhancements align with the program’s learning outcomes and demonstrate my ability to clearly communicate technical ideas to both peers and stakeholders. This process is useful because it encourages thoughtful planning, supports collaboration, and allows feedback before implementation.
