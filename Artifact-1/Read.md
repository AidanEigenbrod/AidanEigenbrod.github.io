# Enhancement-1: Software Engineering & Design

  I chose to use my Course Planner program that I originally developed in my CS 300 class. The purpose of this program is to read a CSV file and obtain information about courses along with their prerequisites. From this, the program allows the user to look up a course and their perquisites or simply look at a full list of the courses. Even though the original program worked properly and fit all the required needs for the assignment it was intended for, it was written in a way that where the functions were separated and not well connected. For this milestone, I updated the program so that it is organized around a single class called CourseManager. 

  I chose this artifact for this milestone because it highlights a program that can work well but can always use improvements such as better organization. Reworking the Course Planner program into a class made the whole structure more organized, with all the parts grouped together in a straightforward way. By doing this, it improves the visual aspect of reviewing the code, as well as shows that you can update an existing program to make it better. It shows my ability to think through how a program should be designed, not just how to make it run. Additionally, this new update helps plans to improve the program even more in the future.
  
  For this enhancement, I wanted to show that I could improve the structure of a program using better design practices which align with the software design and engineering course outcome. I met that goal by reorganizing the project, so it uses a clearer and more organized layout. The update also touches on planning and problem solving, since I had to think through how everything should fit together before making changes.

  When working on the enhancement, I began to think of the same problem in many ways to try and make it better. When I started moving everything into a single class, I had to take some time to understand how the original code flowed and where everything belonged. My biggest obstacle that I faced was ensuring that everything continued to work as I kept working on the program. This taught me that thinking things through before acting upon them is essential to every aspect of developing. Even with that, the process helped me grow more comfortable with improving existing code.
